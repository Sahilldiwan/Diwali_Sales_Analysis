# Diwali_Sales_Analysis
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Diwali Sales Analysis**

This project aims to analyze Diwali sales data to improve customer experience and increase revenue. The analysis will be performed using Python, along with popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

**Objective**

The main objectives of this project are:


Perform exploratory data analysis on Diwali sales data.

Gain insights into customer behavior and preferences.

Identify trends and patterns in sales data.

Identify areas for improvement to enhance customer experience.

Propose strategies to increase revenue based on the analysis.

**Tools Used**

The following tools and libraries were used for this project:

**Google Colab**: It provides a free cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment to execute Python code and analyze data.

**Python**: A widely-used programming language for data analysis and machine learning tasks.

**Pandas**: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, providing data structures and functions to efficiently handle structured data.

**NumPy**: A fundamental library for numerical computations in Python, used for mathematical operations on large arrays and matrices.

**Matplotlib**: A popular data visualization library that enables the creation of various types of plots, charts, and graphs.

**Seaborn**: A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib, providing a higher-level interface for creating attractive and informative visualizations.

**Steps of the Analysis**

The project consists of the following steps:

Data Loading: Load the Diwali sales data into a Pandas DataFrame.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and perform any necessary data cleaning tasks.

Data Exploration: Explore the data by examining its structure, summary statistics, and distributions.

Data Visualization: Create various visualizations to gain insights into the sales data and identify patterns.

Customer Behavior Analysis: Analyze customer behavior and preferences based on the sales data.

Revenue Analysis: Identify factors affecting revenue and propose strategies for revenue improvement.

Conclusion: Summarize the findings of the analysis and propose recommendations for improving customer experience and increasing revenue.

**Usage**

To run this project, follow these steps:

Install Python on your local machine if it is not already installed.

Install the necessary libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Download or clone this project from GitHub.

Open the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file using Google Colab or any compatible environment.

Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute the code and see the results.

Modify the code as needed to customize the analysis according to your specific requirements.
